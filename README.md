The Upper Confidence Bound follows the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty which implies that if we are uncertain about an action, we should optimistically assume that it is the correct action. Imagine an online advertising trial where an advertiser wants to measure the click-through rate of three different ads for the same product. Whenever a user visits the website, the advertiser displays an ad at random. The advertiser then monitors whether the user clicks on the ad or not. After a while, the advertiser notices that one ad seems to be working better than the others. The advertiser must now decide between sticking with the best-performing ad or continuing with the randomized study. If the advertiser only displays one ad, then he can no longer collect data on the other two ads. Perhaps one of the other ads is better, it only appears worse due to chance. If the other two ads are worse, then continuing the study can affect the click-through rate adversely. This advertising trial exemplifies decision-making under uncertainty. In the above example, the role of the agent is played by an advertiser. The advertiser has to choose between three different actions, to display the first, second, or third ad. Each ad is an action. Choosing that ad yields some unknown reward. Finally, the profit of the advertiser after the ad is the reward that the advertiser receives.
